# Demo App running Eva Design - Material

## How to run

- Setup the environment in same way it is described in [UI Kitten docs](https://github.com/akveo/react-native-ui-kitten/blob/master/DEV_DOCS.md#start-a-playground). You may need **Development** environment.
- Go to the `eva` directory and switch branch to `package/material`:
```bash
git checkout package/material
```
- Go to `react-native-ui-kitten` directory and switch branch to `refactor/eva-state-colors` (this should be done untill UI Kitten 4.3 released - [status](https://github.com/akveo/react-native-ui-kitten/pull/728)):
```bash
git checkout refactor/eva-state-colors
```
- `npm start`
